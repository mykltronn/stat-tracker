#The Stat Tracker

##Spec

This project has no front-end for MVP. The project is to build an API that will create and serve and track 'personal statistics' of any kind for user.

'personal statistics' are defined in spec as "a numerical record for a person in a time series by day"

>For example, let's say you wanted to track how many flights of stairs you walked up in a day. A sample week might look like:


|    Date    | Flights |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 06/19/2017 |    8    |
| 06/20/2017 |    6    |
| 06/21/2017 |    7    |
| 06/22/2017 |    6    |
| 06/23/2017 |    8    |
| 06/24/2017 |    4    |
| 06/25/2017 |    6    |

So all endpoints require authentication. Not only that, but user must only have access to their own data.

UX -- sort of.

A user in this case, is theoretically only access data through something like postman.

-- user starts with blank database
-- user
